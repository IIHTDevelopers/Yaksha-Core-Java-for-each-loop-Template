Assessment Tasks for "For Each Loop" Topic
Task 1: Print Array Elements
Problem: Write a program that uses a for-each loop to print all the elements in an array of integers.

Example:

Input:

text
Copy code
Array: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
Output:

text
Copy code
10
20
30
40
50
Explanation: The program will use a for-each loop to iterate through the elements of the array and print them one by one.

Task 2: Sum of Elements in an Array
Problem: Write a program that uses a for-each loop to calculate the sum of all elements in an array of integers.

Example:

Input:

text
Copy code
Array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output:

text
Copy code
Sum: 15
Explanation: The program uses a for-each loop to iterate through each element of the array, adding them together to compute the total sum.

Task 3: Print Characters of a String
Problem: Write a program that uses a for-each loop to print all characters in a string.

Example:

Input:

text
Copy code
String: "Hello"
Output:

text
Copy code
H
e
l
l
o
Explanation: The program uses a for-each loop to iterate over each character in the string and prints it individually.

Task 4: Find Maximum Element in an Array
Problem: Write a program that uses a for-each loop to find the maximum element in an array of integers.

Example:

Input:

text
Copy code
Array: [4, 2, 7, 1, 9, 5]
Output:

text
Copy code
Maximum Element: 9
Explanation: The program uses a for-each loop to iterate through the elements of the array, keeping track of the maximum value found during the iteration.

Task 5: Count Occurrences of a Specific Element in an Array
Problem: Write a program that uses a for-each loop to count how many times a specific element appears in an array of integers.

Example:

Input:

text
Copy code
Array: [2, 4, 2, 7, 2, 9, 2]
Element to search for: 2
Output:

text
Copy code
Occurrences of 2: 4
Explanation: The program uses a for-each loop to iterate through the array and count the occurrences of the specified element.
